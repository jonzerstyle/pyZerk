**PyZerk**
===================
Three week project where I attempted to learn python and make my first working game.  Aiming to create a Berserk like game.  

youtube video of some gameplay:

Recently I found this project on github which is much better and polished clone of berserk: 

https://github.com/flyingthing/PyBerzerk

I would also like to leave credit to an example pygame project which helped immensely dealing 
with object collections and basics of a pygame that I leveraged:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/asteroidsinf/

**REQUIREMENTS:**

install
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.msi

then install this and point at previous local installation location
http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py2.7.msi

then execute run.bat from folder and have fun

left cntrl is fire - hold and use arrows to stand ground and shoot 
otherwise run with cursor

lives are unlimited
as you die levels increase - basically robots move faster too a point and then
game goes back to level zero 

voices were created using a articifial voice program called eSpeak

when you run into a wall or robot - that was me going aghahgahghagh - hahah

blasting effects were created using SoX

fun game to make - not complete - but learned python and a game in 3 weeks not bad 

if you browse src code you will see the basic vector math etc... 

pygame did the collision detection work - and the low level graphics and sound the rest was done
in python by me

Objects were created on the fly using hardcoded vector points
not blipped - less efficient maybe but more old skool hardcore...  I punched in manual
vector points
the robots the players the bullets are all code created versus blipped in bitmaps...

A friend got it running on android just for heck of it (you may notice some artifacts of this in the files) ... its not a good game for a phone but it ran pretty good on a cell phone throughput wise...

Audacity is a great free converter for audio.  I used it to convert a thrown together song I made using Reason in wav to ogg format.
